what is this?

This is the code for the website of the Chico State Linux User Group (CSLUG).
The site is currently undergoing a rebuild; check out the old/current site code
under the `2010site` branch.

can i contribute?
-----------------
Yes! Please do! If you're new to git, don't be intimidated. GitHub has [very
helpful instructions][1] on forking repositories, and it's the easiest way (for
both parties) to contribute or fix code.

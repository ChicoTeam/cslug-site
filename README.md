cslug-site
----------
This is the code for the website of the Chico State Linux User Group (CSLUG).
The site is currently undergoing a rebuild; check out the old/current site code
under the `2010site` branch.

How do I contribute?
-----------------
Just fork and do whatever you want, then pull request. Don't be shy with it; if
you see something that could be better, make it better and rub it in everyone's
faces afterwards for the warm fuzzies. And remember that this is a club project
-- don't make suggestions; make changes.

If you're new to git, don't be intimidated. GitHub has [very helpful
instructions][1] on forking repositories, and it's the easiest way (for both
parties) to contribute or fix code.

If you're a member looking to add yourself to the site's memberlist, just fork
us, add/commit/push your member file according to [the memberfile README][2],
then submit a pull request.

How does this repo relate to the live site?
-------------------------------------------
We're actually planning on deploying the most recent commit here to the live
site on a nightly basis, but that's not quite set up yet.

What do I need to run the site locally?
-----------------------------------------------
You should be able to get by with just PHP5 and a webserver capable of using it.

Who's the boss?
---------------
Angela.

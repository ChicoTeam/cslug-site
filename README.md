What is this?
-------------
This is the code for the website of the Chico State Linux User Group (CSLUG).
The site is currently undergoing a rebuild; check out the old/current site code
under the `2010site` branch.

Can I contribute?
-----------------
Yes! Please do! If you're new to git, don't be intimidated. GitHub has [very
helpful instructions][1] on forking repositories, and it's the easiest way (for
both parties) to contribute or fix code.

How does this repo relate to the live site?
-------------------------------------------
We're actually planning on deploying the most recent commit here to the live
site on a nightly basis, but it's not set up yet.

What do i need to run this on my local machine?
-----------------------------------------------
PHP5+ and a webserver. You can try on PHP4 but nothing's been tested.

Who's the boss?
---------------
Angela.

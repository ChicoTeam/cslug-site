About me, Glenn Simpkins:

Fresh out of High School in 2005, my initial plan was to study agriculture, starting at Butte College and moving on to Chico State for the Bachelors degree once my general education was complete. The end goal at the time was to teach High School. After realizing that I had impulsive reasons for going into the field and the work I had in mind doing would be a poor fit, I had to find something else.

In the fall of 2008, Computer Science piqued my interest. I began studying it in earnest in the spring of 2009 when I took my first programming class at Butte. As Chico State has a reputation of being one of the top institutions for Computer Science, I thought it wise to transfer there as I had originally planned, albeit with an entirely different direction.

What I hope to get out of CSLUG is beneficial friendships and an education on better using Ubuntu and Linux that cannot be gotten in the classroom.
